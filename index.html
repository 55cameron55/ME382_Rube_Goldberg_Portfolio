        <p style="text-indent: 2rem;">This portfolio documents the design process and development of a Rube Goldberg machine, a complex contraption that performs a simple task through a series of intricate steps. The project is structured into four main phases, each addressing specific aspects of the design process, from problem identification to final evaluation and reflection.</p>

        <p style="text-indent: 2rem;">My Rube Goldberg section was designed to complete the task of converting rotational energy (from a previous phase fly wheel) into a stream of water. This Portfolio aims to demonstrate the application of engineering design principles, creativity, and technical skills used throughout the project.</p>

        <p style="text-indent: 2rem;">Stakeholders were identified using a three tier system including Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary stakeholders. Primary stakeholders are those who are directly affected by the problem and solution, secondary stakeholders have an indirect interest, and tertiary stakeholders have a broader societal or environmental interest. Each stakeholder group was analyzed to understand their needs, concerns, and potential impact on the project. The following list illistrates the three types of stakeholders with representations from each category and their needs.</p>

        <p><strong>Primary Stakeholders</strong><br>
        1.  Myself/ My team - Need to design a reliable, easy to fabricate, and functioning product.<br>
        2.	Instructor - Needs the design and documentation to demonstrate comprehension of learning objectives. <br>
        3.	Audience / Classmates- Need the assembly to be visually engaging and clearly understandable.  <br></p>

        <p><strong>Secondary Stakeholders</strong><br>
        1.	Previous group in chain - Need to be able to receive a compatible input. <br>
        2.	Following group in chain - Need to deliver a consistent compatible output.<br>
        3.	Material suppliers - Readily available parts that are easy to source and affordable.<br>
        4.	Safety staff - Need the project to minimize hazards.<br></p>

        <p><strong>Tertiary Stakeholders</strong><br>
        1.	Future employer - Need the project documentation and design portfolio to showcase technical competence and creativity.<br>
        2.	Future Rube Goldberg machine designers - Need Inspiration for future designs.<br>
        3.	Future ME 382 students - Need examples of the design process and iterations.<br>
        4.	University accreditors - Need the project to demonstrate alignment with program learning outcomes.<br></p>

        <p style="text-indent: 2rem;">Based on the analysis of stakeholders and the engineering specs, the following house of quality was established for my section of the Rube Goldberg machine:</p>

        <img src="HOQ.png" alt="House of Quality Image" class="section-image">

            <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 0;">
                Figure 1: House of Quality
            </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 2rem;">Exisiting Rube Goldberg mechanisms can be compared and scored against our existing house of quality requirements. The following mechanisms were evaluated:</p>

        <p><strong>Competing Products:</strong><br>
        A) Domino chain<br>
        B) Ball and ramp<br>
        C) Pulley system<br></p>

        <p style="text-indent: 2rem;">These competing products (A though C) can be seen in the house of quality figure above. Each mechanism was graded on how it meets the requirements on a scale from 1 to 5. 1 meaning the mechanism does not meet the requirement at all, and 5 meaning the mechanism fully meets the requirement. It can bee seen that these standard products do not fufill our requirements, therefore we can proceed to design our own solution.</p>

    <section id="section2">
        <h2 style="text-align: center"><strong>- Phase 2: Generating and Analyzing an Original Solution -</strong></h2>

        <!--
        Element E: Design concept generation, analysis, and selection (Module 4 and 5) - Design concepts, pugh chart, final choice. initial math. 
            “The process for generating and comparing possible design solutions was comprehensive, iterative, and consistently defensible, making a viable and well-justified design highly likely; the design solution ultimately chosen was well-justified and demonstrated attention to all design requirements; the plan of action has considerable merit and would easily support repetition and testing for effectiveness by others.”

        Element F: Application of STEM principles and practices through analysis (Module 5) - classmate feedback.
            “The proposed solution is well-substantiated with STEM principles and practices applicable to all or nearly all design requirements and functional claims; there is substantial evidence that the application of those principles and practices by the student has been reviewed by two students in the class and an expert (course instructor, at time of homework assessment) and that those reviews provide confirmation (verification) or detail necessary to inform a corrective response.”
        -->

        <p style="text-indent: 2rem;">The first step in generating an original solution is to create a list of functions that our design could preform. These functions relate to the porential input and output functions of a typical Rube Goldberg machine.</p>

        <p><strong>Function list:</strong><br>
        1.  Detect input.<br>
        2.  Secure input.<br>
        3.  Convert input kinetic energy into signal.<br>
        4.  Convert electrical energy into mechanical rotational energy.<br>
        5.  Convert electrical energy into heat.<br>
        6.  Convert electrical energy into light energy.<br>
        7.  Convert rotational energy into pneumatic gas pressure.<br>
        8.  Convert rotational energy into translational force.<br>
        9.  Transform Light energy into signal energy.<br>
        10. Transform pneumatic gas into linear transformation.<br></p>

        <p style="text-indent: 2rem;">Once our list of functions has been defined, we can begin to develop a preliminary product sketch. For this inital design I choose to utilize a input of a linear force and an output of a ball rolling. Figure 2 below dipicts the preliminary sketch that converts linear force to linear transformation using eletrical mechanical energy, eletric to rotational conversion, and pnematic to linear transformations.</p>

                Figure 2: Preliminary Product Sketch
            </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 2rem;">The preliminary product sketch was converted into a funtion structure/decomposition diagram show in figure 3 below. This functional decompostion ideates the specific subfuntions necessary for the product to preform using Stone's taxonomy. It also illistrates the function flow of materials, signals, and energy shown in blue, orange, and yellow respectively. The figure flows from left to right throughout the system.</p>

                Figure 3: Functional Decomposition Diagram
            </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 2rem;">A morphology table was created to explore the design space and identify potential solutions. Three functions were chosen to be explored in the morphology table; Convert rotational energy into translational force, Transform pneumatic gas into linear transformation, and Convert rotational energy into pneumatic gas pressure. Using the baseline transformations, 9 designs could be created for comparision.</p>

        <img src="Morphology.png" alt="Initial Morphology Table" class="section-image">

            </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 2rem;">For my section of the Rube Goldberg machine three functions were chosen to be used as outputs. Three inputs were also supplied by the previous system. The following lists show the input and output options going forward, and nine combinations were ideated as shown in the figures to follow.</p>

        <p><strong>Output options:</strong><br>
            1. Turn on a 1-2 MOA (1-2" dot size at 100 yards) red laser with a wavelength of 630 - 700 nm. The laser will remain on for a minimum of 5 seconds. The beam will be oriented horizontally and mounted 2" off the ground ± 0.050".<br>
            2. Dispense a stream of room temperature water (70°C) at a flow rate of 100mL/sec ± 20mL/sec from a nozzle located 24" ± 0.050" off the ground with a trajectory starting normal to the vertical face (Horizontal output but will be parabolic due to gravity). The stream will remain on for a minimum of 4 seconds.<br>
            3. Cut a 4mm diameter black nylon paracord. Construction is 550 lb tensile strength (type III, 550) with 7 inner strands under tension (tied to whatever you want that can produce up to 550 lb of tension). Minimum tension of 5 lbs. The rope will be located 24" off the ground with a minimum of 3" clearance to the support structure. The rope will hang down.<br></p>

        <p><strong>Input options from previous team:</strong><br> 
            1. 1kg mass traveling at 1m/s horizontally.<br>
            2. 2kg mass flywheel of diameter 25cm rotating at 2pi rad/s vertically.<br>
            3. 10g mass falling 0.5m vertically.<br></p>

            Element G: Computational modeling of concept assembly (Module 6)
            “The final concept iteration is clearly and fully explained and is constructed via CAD with enough detail to assure that objective data on all or nearly all design requirements could be determined; all attributes (sub-systems) of the unique solution that can be tested or modeled mathematically are addressed and a well-supported justification is provided for those that cannot be tested or modeled mathematically and thus require expert review.”

        Element H: Full physics and engineering analysis (Module 7)
            “Through the conduct of several tests for high priority requirements that are reasonable based on instructional contexts, or through physical or mathematical modeling, the student demonstrates considerable understanding of testing procedure, including the gathering and analysis of resultant data; the analysis of the effectiveness with which the design met stated goals includes a consistently detailed explanation and summary of the data from each portion of the testing procedure and from expert reviews, generously supported by pictures, graphs, charts and other visuals; the analysis includes an overall summary of the implications of all data for proceeding with the design and solving the problem.”

        Element I: Simulation/computational testing and data collection (Module 8 and 9)
            “The Simulation/Computational Testing plan addresses all of the high priority design requirements by effectively describing the conduct (through physical and/or mathematical modeling) of those tests that are feasible based on the instructional context and providing for others a logical and well-developed explanation.”

        Element J: Documentation of external evaluation (Module 1 through 10)
            “Documentation of project evaluation by a demonstrably qualified stakeholder and field expert is presented and is synthesized in a consistently specific, detailed, and thorough way; documentation is sufficient across three or more modules to yield meaningful analysis of that evaluation data; the synthesis of evaluations consistently addresses evaluators' specific questions, concerns, and opinions related to design requirements.”

        Element K: Reflection on the design project (Module 10)
            “The project designer provides a consistently clear, insightful, and comprehensive reflection on, and value judgment of, each major step in the project; the reflection includes a substantive summary of lessons learned that would be clearly useful to others attempting the same or similar project.”

        Element L: Presentation of designers recommendations (Module 10)
            “The project designer includes consistently detailed and salient recommendations regarding the conduct of the same or similar project in the future; recommendations include caveats as warranted and specific ways the project could be improved with consistently detailed plans for the implementation of those improvements.”
