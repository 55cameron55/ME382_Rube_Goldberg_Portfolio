    <section id="section1">
        <h2>Phase 1: Presenting and Justifying a Problem and Its Solution Requirements</h2>

        <p><strong>Element A: Presentation and justification of the problem (M1 and M2)</strong><br>
        “The problem is clearly and objectively identified and defined with considerable depth, and it is well elaborated with specific detail; the justification of the problem highlights the concerns of many primary stakeholders and is based on comprehensive, timely, and consistently credible sources; it offers consistently objective detail from which multiple measurable design requirements can be determined.”</p>

        <img src="Portfolio flowchart-1.png" alt="Test picture 1" class="section-image">

        <p><strong>Element B: Documentation and analysis of products with similar functions (M2)</strong><br>
        “Documentation of similar existing products that solve the problem and/or related problems is drawn from a wide array of clearly identified and consistently credible sources; the analysis of past and current products—including both strengths and shortcomings—is consistently clear, detailed, and supported by relevant data.”</p>

        <p><strong>Element C: Presentation and justification of solution design requirements (M3)</strong><br>
        “Design requirements are listed and prioritized, and they are consistently clear and detailed; these design requirements presented are consistently objective, measurable, and they would be highly likely to lead to a tangible and viable solution to the problem identified; there is evidence that requirements represent the needs of, and have been validated by, many if not all primary stakeholder groups.”</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <section id="section2">
        <h2>Phase 2: Generating and Analyzing an Original Solution</h2>

        <p><strong>Element D: Design for function (M3)</strong><br>
        “The definitions of functions are accurate and use the prescribed taxonomy (or are more specific); the function structure has been iterated and is complete and correct, with all functional flows accurately represented and defined. The function structure includes multiple interior subfunctions, including at least one subfunction that converts an electrical energy input. No components are included anywhere in the function structure, enabling the student to design for function as opposed to being constrained to specific components to carry the function.”</p>

        <p><strong>Element E: Design concept generation, analysis, and selection (M4, M5)</strong><br>
        “The process for generating and comparing possible design solutions was comprehensive, iterative, and consistently defensible, making a viable and well-justified design highly likely; the design solution ultimately chosen was well-justified and demonstrated attention to all design requirements; the plan of action has considerable merit and would easily support repetition and testing for effectiveness by others.”</p>

        <p><strong>Element F: Application of STEM principles and practices through analysis (M5)</strong><br>
        “The proposed solution is well-substantiated with STEM principles and practices applicable to all or nearly all design requirements and functional claims; there is substantial evidence that the application of those principles and practices by the student has been reviewed by two students in the class and an expert (course instructor, at time of homework assessment) and that those reviews provide confirmation (verification) or detail necessary to inform a corrective response.”</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <section id="section3">
        <h2>Phase 3: Detailed Design, Prototyping, and Simulation</h2>

        <p><strong>Element G: Computational modeling of concept assembly (M6)</strong><br>
        “The final concept iteration is clearly and fully explained and is constructed via CAD with enough detail to assure that objective data on all or nearly all design requirements could be determined; all attributes (sub-systems) of the unique solution that can be tested or modeled mathematically are addressed and a well-supported justification is provided for those that cannot be tested or modeled mathematically and thus require expert review.”</p>

        <p><strong>Element H: Full physics and engineering analysis (M7)</strong><br>
        “Through the conduct of several tests for high priority requirements that are reasonable based on instructional contexts, or through physical or mathematical modeling, the student demonstrates considerable understanding of testing procedure, including the gathering and analysis of resultant data; the analysis of the effectiveness with which the design met stated goals includes a consistently detailed explanation and summary of the data from each portion of the testing procedure and from expert reviews, generously supported by pictures, graphs, charts and other visuals; the analysis includes an overall summary of the implications of all data for proceeding with the design and solving the problem.”</p>

        <p><strong>Element I: Simulation/computational testing and data collection (M8 and M9)</strong><br>
        “The Simulation/Computational Testing plan addresses all of the high priority design requirements by effectively describing the conduct (through physical and/or mathematical modeling) of those tests that are feasible based on the instructional context and providing for others a logical and well-developed explanation.”</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <section id="section4">
        <h2>Phase 4: Evaluation, Reflection, and Recommendations</h2>

        <p><strong>Element J: Documentation of external evaluation (M1–10)</strong><br>
        “Documentation of project evaluation by a demonstrably qualified stakeholder and field expert is presented and is synthesized in a consistently specific, detailed, and thorough way; documentation is sufficient across three or more modules to yield meaningful analysis of that evaluation data; the synthesis of evaluations consistently addresses evaluators' specific questions, concerns, and opinions related to design requirements.”</p>

        <p><strong>Element K: Reflection on the design project (M10)</strong><br>
        “The project designer provides a consistently clear, insightful, and comprehensive reflection on, and value judgment of, each major step in the project; the reflection includes a substantive summary of lessons learned that would be clearly useful to others attempting the same or similar project.”</p>

        <p><strong>Element L: Presentation of designers’ recommendations (M10)</strong><br>
        “The project designer includes consistently detailed and salient recommendations regarding the conduct of the same or similar project in the future; recommendations include caveats as warranted and specific ways the project could be improved with consistently detailed plans for the implementation of those improvements.”</p>
